# DotCoin

Right, so, This is going to be a nice WPF application showing the current prices of crypto according to coincap and
right its also going to predict the prices. How? maths.
Im going to be using a couple of indicators and prediciting algorithms to get success. Will it work? Maybe. But yk what,
it's all about learning.

This project's core focuses are : REST API, WPF, Crypto / Stock Market algorithms, C#


Stuff remaining to do:
- News feed (web scrape)
- Serving an Api with the prices that I predict etc\n
- Dump csv file of prices etc
